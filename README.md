# fanController.Releases
This is the releases repository of the fan controller software and board.

The project started in late 2019 when i was just starting to try different things with arduino boards. I quickly realized i could build a board to control fans, and thus I created a very basic software to control them. After that I started playing with OpenHardwareMonitor integration, but when i realized that that project kind of died, switched to LibreHardwareMonitor.
